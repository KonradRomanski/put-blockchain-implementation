# Put Blockchain Implementation

Welcome to the `put-blockchain-implementation` repository! This repository is a simple implementation of a blockchain.

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data.
